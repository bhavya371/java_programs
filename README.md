This repository contains **four Java programs** designed to practice and demonstrate core programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), loops, conditionals, arrays, and maps.

## Programs Overview

1. Calculator Using Class
A simple calculator built using a Java class that performs:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division  
**Inputs:**  
- `a` (double) – First number  
- `b` (double) – Second number  
- `operation` (String) – Type of operation (e.g., `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`)  
**Concepts Used:** Classes, methods, user input, switch-case.

 2.Odd Number Series
Generates a series of **odd numbers** from 1 up to the given count.
- Example:  
  - Input: `4` → Output: `1, 3, 5, 7`  
**Concepts Used:** Loops, list generation, mathematical patterns.

 3.Conditional Odd Number Series
Generates odd number series with a **conditional rule**:
- Odd input → Generates full odd series.
- Even input → Generates odd series up to the previous odd number.  
- Example:  
  - Input: `4` → Output: `1, 3, 5`  
  - Input: `5` → Output: `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`  
**Concepts Used:** Loops, conditional logic.

 4.Multiples Counter
Counts how many numbers in a list are **multiples of each number from 1 to 9**.
- Example:  
  - Input: `[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]`  
  - Output: `{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}`  
**Concepts Used:** Arrays, maps, loops, modulo operation.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **Concepts:** OOP, loops, conditional statements, arrays, maps.
